## Hardware Configuration

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| GPU | NVIDIA A40 |
| VRAM | 47.6 GB |
| Platform | RunPods |
| Cost | ~$0.69/hr |

## Dataset

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Total variants | 50,715 |
| Splice-altering | 13,673 |
| Normal | 11,358 |
| Low-frequency | 25,601 |
| Conflicting | 83 |

### Train/Test Split
- **Train**: 49,282 variants (chromosomes 1-20, X)
- **Test**: 1,433 variants (chromosomes 21, 22)
- **Balanced training**: 22,132 samples (11,066 SA + 11,066 Normal)

## Experiments

### 1. Quick Test (Sanity Check)

**Config**: 1,000 samples, 40 epochs, batch_size=32

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Pearson correlation | r = 0.504 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.583 |
| PR-AUC | 0.616 |
| Status | ✅ Complete |

**Notes**: Baseline established, GPU pipeline working correctly.

### 2. Full Dataset (50K samples)

**Config**: 
- max_train=50,000
- max_test=5,000  
- epochs=50
- batch_size=64
- hidden_dim=128
- n_layers=6

| Metric | Expected | Result | Notes |
|--------|----------|--------|-------|
| Pearson correlation | r > 0.55 | **r = 0.353** | ⚠️ Lower than quick test! |
| ROC-AUC | > 0.65 | 0.582 | Similar to quick test |
| PR-AUC | > 0.70 | **0.692** | ✅ Improved |
| Detection @ 0.1 | - | 28.2% | - |
| False positive | - | 14.0% | - |

**Duration**: 52.4 minutes  
**Status**: ⚠️ Complete - Correlation degraded

### Training Loss Progression
```
Epoch  1/50: loss = 0.014082
Epoch 10/50: loss = 0.011290
Epoch 20/50: loss = 0.010972
Epoch 30/50: loss = 0.010499
Epoch 40/50: loss = 0.005335
Epoch 50/50: loss = 0.001918  ← Model converged
```

### ⚠️ Analysis: Why Did Correlation Decrease?

This is counterintuitive - more data should improve results. Possible causes:

1. **Overfitting**: Loss decreased to 0.002 which may be too low. Model memorized training patterns.

2. **Test Set Difference**: Chromosomes 21/22 may have different characteristics than training set.

3. **Target Noise Amplification**: With more samples, the base model's predictions (used as targets for SA variants) may have accumulated more noise.

4. **Class Distribution Shift**: The balanced sampling may not represent the true test distribution.

5. **Hyperparameter Mismatch**: Quick test with 1K samples may need different hyperparameters than 50K.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Add regularization**: Increase dropout, add early stopping
2. **Reduce epochs**: Stop at epoch 20-30 based on validation loss
3. **Use validation set**: Monitor validation loss during training
4. **Analyze per-class performance**: Check SA vs Normal correlation separately
5. **Learning rate schedule**: Use cosine annealing or reduce on plateau

### 3. HyenaDNA Experiment (Planned)

**Config**: HyenaDNA encoder with validated delta targets

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Model | hyenadna-tiny-1k-seqlen |
| Freeze encoder | True (initial) |
| Epochs | 40 |

**Status**: ⏳ Pending (after full_dataset completes)

## Observations

### Data Preparation Insights

1. **SpliceVarDB Distribution**: 
   - ~27% Splice-altering (clear positive class)
   - ~22% Normal (clear negative class)  
   - ~51% Low-frequency/Conflicting (uncertain, excluded from training)

2. **Balanced Sampling**: Using equal SA/Normal samples helps prevent class imbalance issues.

3. **Validated Delta Target Strategy**:
   - SA variants: Use base model delta (trusted because SpliceVarDB confirms)
   - Normal variants: Force zero delta (override base model - we know there's no effect)
   - This creates high-quality training signal

### GPU Utilization

- A40 with 47.6 GB VRAM easily handles batch_size=64
- Could potentially increase to batch_size=128 for faster training

## Results Summary

| Experiment | Correlation | ROC-AUC | PR-AUC | Status |
|------------|-------------|---------|--------|--------|
| Quick Test (1K) | **0.504** | 0.583 | 0.616 | ✅ |
| Full Dataset (50K) | 0.353 | 0.582 | **0.692** | ⚠️ Overfitting? |
| HyenaDNA | - | - | - | ⏳ |

**Key Finding**: More data led to *worse* correlation but better PR-AUC. This suggests the model is learning to rank samples correctly (PR-AUC) but losing calibration for continuous delta prediction (correlation).
